Welcome to qthelp docs.

This project aims to build documentation for use in the qt assistant using
sphinx for the following projects:


- Python
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Sympy
- PySerial
- Matplotlib


Usage
-----

To build the docs, simply run make_docs.sh. The documentation will be
generated eventually in the docs folder. The .qch files can be included
in the qt assistant for easy browsing.

Download
--------

The docs are also built by drone.io:
